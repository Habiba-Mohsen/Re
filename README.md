# Real-Time Digital Filter Design Application

Welcome to the Real-Time Digital Filter Design application! This desktop application allows users to design custom digital filters by placing zeros and poles on the z-plane.
Users can visualize the filter's frequency response, apply it to a real-time signal, and correct for phase using All-Pass filters.

## Features

1. **Z-Plane Plot:**
   - Place zeros and poles on the z-plane.
   - Modify zeros/poles by dragging.
   - Delete selected zero or pole.
   - Clear all zeros, clear all poles, or clear all elements.
   - Option to add conjugates for complex elements.

2. **Frequency Response Plot:**
   - Visualize the magnitude and phase response of the designed filter.

3. **Real-time Filtering:**
   - Apply the filter to a lengthy signal in real-time.
   - Control the speed/temporal-resolution of the filtering process using a slider.
   - Input an arbitrary real-time signal by moving the mouse.

4. **All-Pass Filters:**
   - Library of pre-built all-pass filters with visualizations.
   - Add one or more all-pass filters to the original design.
   - Custom-built all-pass: Input arbitrary coefficients to calculate phase response.
